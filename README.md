# local-gov-gis-solutions
A collection of solutions for common city and county GIS pain points and workflows.

# Organization
These are mostly one-off scripts. Documentation is provided at the top of each
script. Each script is designed to "plug and play" with user-specified variables.

## Python  
Scripts are written in python 3.5+ and use the top level script environment:
__main__ so they are designed to be executed as a script called from the command
line or an interactive prompt.

'''python script_name.py'''

There are also a few jupyter notebooks (ipynb files) to visually demonstrate
web-GIS things using the arcgis python API
